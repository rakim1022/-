       <p class="title">This album, “sound without yet meaning” was a collection of works within the bigger project of B20 Hidden Inventory. However, due to its delayed release, it soon became its own independent project, irrelevant of its relations with B20. Sound Without Yet Meaning is a mash and mixture of sounds and nuances that best attempt to illustrate my first 20 years in life. Through a chronological order, the sounds exhibit my childhood and my continuous growth toward adulthood, expressing the many highs and lows within the journey. Perhaps, the many songs won’t feel like independent yet rather dependant to its overall contribution to the album and surely it is. Each song is entirely dependent on the album as each song doesn’t represent itself yet the collective experience and expression of the album itself. Experimental at times, out right stupid at times, I hope it will hold a reflective reaction to the viewer as it was many moments of discussion with my past and present self making this album.</p>

       <p>아직 의미없는 나의 소리는 원래 B20에 있는 프로젝트였다. 하지만 앨범제작이 지체되면서 또하나의 새로운 프로젝트가 되었다.
        아직 의미없는 나의 소리는 내가 스물살이라는 나이가 되기까지 어렸을때부터 내가 느꼈던 감정들과 생각들을 다 녹음하고 
        소리로 기억하는 작업이다. 당연히 나의 생각 ,감정그리고 믿음은 미래에 변화될 수도 있으므로 아직 의미없는 소리이다.
        리스너들께 바라는 사항은 곡들을 듣는것보다 앨범을 듣는 것이다.</p>
